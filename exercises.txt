2. What classes/entities do we need to model?

   Students, Classes, Grades

   What fields/attributes will each entity need? & What data types do we need to use?

   Students:
     id         integer
     first_name text
     last_name  text
     email      text

   Classes:
     id           integer
     name         text
     teacher      text

   Grades
     student_id   integer
     class_id     integer
     grade        text


   What relationships exist between entities?

   Students and Classes have a many-to-many relationship. In order to implement the
   relationship the Grades entity will serve as a join table to allow for creating
   foreign keys to make the relationship between a student and their class.

   A student can have many instances of grades where they are referenced.
   A class can have many instances of grades where it is referenced.

   How should those relationships be represented in tables?

   A row in the grades table will represent a relationship between a row of the students
   table and a row in the classes table.

   *Assumptions, my brain wants to put a student as an attribute of the classes table
   to show that they are in that class, which is not right. In order to break things down
   to their most basic and unique essence each student will have a row in the students
   table, each class will have a row in the classes table, and the grades table will
   serve to record and represent that a student was in a class and furthermore it will
   add the value that they earned a grade in the class and will even tell us what that
   grade is.
