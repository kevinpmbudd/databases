2. A Database might be used anytime a collection of data needs to be stored
   and retrieved. Whether that is a bank keeping records of an account, or
   Google keeping tabs on my digital life. Just about anything we do can be
   represented as data and is therefore storable in a database. If data can
   be leveraged for some type of gain, it will be collected and used. In the
   context of when to use a Text file instead of a Database, if there was
   only a single text file and it was not going to be changed then it could
   just be stored as a text file. Or if the data was not to be broken down at
   all and just needed to be stored as one lump text file.

3. SQL is declarative and not procedural, meaning that as a user we can 'tell'
   the database what we want in the language of SQL and expect it to respond
   with what we asked for. This is contrasted by procedural languages where
   we write code that tells the computer what to do OR how to do what we want
   it to do with the data in question.

4. How the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level. A database
   is made up of tables. A table might contain all the users for a website. A
   table arranges data in a logical structure made of columns and rows. A column
   might contain the username of each user. A row contains all of the columns
   stored about one user. As a user of a database we can use SQL to write statements
   which request data from a database, or request to make changes of that data.
   In one scenario, by way of a web server, the data contained in a database can
   be made available to applications through an application interface, an API.

5. Table  - A collection of related data in a structure format.
   Row    - One record from a database table.
   Column - One category of data held in a table about each record.
   Value  - The data stored in a single cell of a database table (where one
            row and one column intersect.)

6. Date, String, Decimal
